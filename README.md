# Exercise 1
- If the interest rate is less than 7, print("The interest rate is less than seven")
- If the interest rate is greater than 24.5, print("The interest rate is greater than 24.5"
- Else print the total loan repayment as well as the monthly installment.
- Fix the spelling mistake on the README.md file only

Good luck :)
